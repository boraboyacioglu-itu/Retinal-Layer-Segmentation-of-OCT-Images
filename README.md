# Retinal Layer Segmentation of OCT Images

This is a study conducted by Öykü Eren, 150200326 and Bora Boyacıoğlu, 150200310.

For this project, it is important to note that we only worked with some amount of the data, because of the limited computational powers. Even with the A100 GPU alongside the high RAM capacity, 86GB of RAM and 40GB of GPU RAM was not enough for the whole dataset. Therefore, only OCT data is utilised. For the mask prediction model, we used a total of 100 samples (50 from 6mm, 50 from 3mm) and 20 slices for each sample. And for the anomaly detection, we used a total of 300 samples and 50 slices for each.
